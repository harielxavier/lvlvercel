[8/30/25, 9:15:31‚ÄØPM] Knights Support Chat: Behavioral Intelligence & Rising Star Detection
‚Äá1.‚Å† ‚Å†"Collaboration Impact Score"
Track how feedback mentions collaboration keywords vs. conflict indicators. Rising stars get praised for "team player," "helpful," while problematic individuals get feedback mentioning "difficult," "unresponsive." Auto-flag patterns without explicit toxicity detection.

‚Äá2.‚Å† ‚Å†"Response Quality Analytics"
Monitor feedback response rates and sentiment. Rising stars consistently receive more voluntary feedback; problematic individuals either get minimal feedback or responses with subtle negative sentiment patterns. Track who people choose to give feedback to.

‚Äá3.‚Å† ‚Å†"Peer Nomination Patterns"
Add "Would you want to work with this person again?" and "Who made your project successful?" in project retrospectives. Rising stars get consistently nominated; problematic individuals get conspicuously overlooked or negative sentiment.

‚Äá4.‚Å† ‚Å†"Goal Achievement Accelerators"
Track who helps others achieve their goals through cross-references in goal comments/updates. Rising stars get mentioned in others' goal successes; problematic individuals rarely get credited for helping others succeed.

‚Äá5.‚Å† ‚Å†"Meeting Contribution Scoring"
Post-meeting micro-surveys: "Who contributed most valuable insights?" "Who helped move discussions forward?" Built into the meetings feature - patterns emerge showing who consistently adds value vs. who doesn't.

‚Äá6.‚Å† ‚Å†"Knowledge Sharing Index"
Track who gets tagged in knowledge-sharing activities, internal questions, or mentioned as "go-to person" in feedback. Rising stars become knowledge hubs; problematic individuals are rarely sought for expertise.

‚Äá7.‚Å† ‚Å†"Emotional Intelligence Indicators"
Analyze feedback language for empathy markers ("understands," "supportive," "listens") vs. concerning patterns ("dismissive," "interrupts," "confusing"). Use sentiment analysis on feedback received.

‚Äá8.‚Å† ‚Å†"Initiative Recognition Engine"
Track who gets credited for starting improvements, suggesting solutions, or volunteering for challenges in feedback and goal descriptions. Rising stars consistently show initiative; others don't.

‚Äá9.‚Å† ‚Å†"Cross-Department Bridge Score"
Monitor inter-departmental collaboration mentions in feedback and goals. Rising stars get praised for breaking down silos; problematic individuals may create departmental tensions mentioned in feedback.

10.‚Å† ‚Å†"Leadership Readiness Pipeline"
Combine multiple signals: mentoring others (mentioned in feedback), conflict resolution (helping others achieve goals), and cultural ambassadorship (positive sentiment in 360 reviews). Auto-surface leadership candidates.
